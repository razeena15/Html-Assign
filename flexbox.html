          <h2>Cooking</h2>
          <p>Cooking is an art in which I have such immense passion for in life..
            Not only does it compliment to art, and music, it creates satisfaction for your body and mind.
            I can remember always being caught as a child in the kitchen trying to make up some sort of imaginative stupid  recipe.
            One of my greatest and treasured memories would consist of food...
             A delicieux Recipe is the one which we learn from our Mother and Grandmothers... 
             I believe a Recipe has no soul, but You as THE COOK must bring the soul to the recipe...

         <h2>My passion</h2>
          <p>You Don't have to cook fancy complicated masterpieces but just a simple good Food with Fresh ingredients.. Fortunately there have been no incidents yet while I cook, because I am an amateur cook..Happiness is In Home made food..It is the true act of LOVE. Even if the food doesn't come out well never stop cooking. Because Cooking brings Happiness!!!
